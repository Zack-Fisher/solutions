## Road Signs and Symbols

* blinking red light == stop sign. wait until everything's safe to go.
* blinking yellow light == yield. proceed with caution, it's a warning.
* dotted yellow line next to solid yellow line == can drive through the dotted one, cannot pass on the solid line.
* in general, the dotted line means that you can cross through it, the solid line means the opposite.

* yellow and black sign == warning/caution.

## Traffic Laws

## Safe Driving Practices

* maintain a two second distance between the car in-front of you on the road.
* if you're in a minor accident, move the car out of the way, if you can.
* look and listen for a train before crossing, be careful not to stop on the tracks.

## Parking Rules

## Vehicle Control

## Driving Impairments

* BAC limit is 0.08% for people over 21.
* even if you're not holding it, you CANNOT use your phone at all while driving. (only for EMERGENCY CALLS.)

## Documentation and Requirements

## Intersections and Lane Changes

* The car that arrived first usually has the right of way. this is at least true at a four-way intersection.

## Pedestrian and Bicycle Rules

## Special Driving Conditions

* use your highbeams on OPEN ROADS with no street lighting. try to avoid using them around other people on the road.
* using your highbeams in the fog is actually a bad idea. it'll decrease visibility and reflect the fog back at you.
* always stop for a school bus, act very careful around them. they have stop signs on the left side of the school bus. don't pass them.

### parking on hills

* ANGLE WHEELS TOWARD THE CURB.

* need to contend with gravity, much more dangerous than parking on flat ground.
* in general, the idea is to angle your wheels and park in such a way that total brake failure will not 
    result in the car rolling into traffic lanes.

    * Uphill with a curb
        * When parked facing uphill and there is a curb present, drivers should turn the vehicle's wheels away from the curb.
            If the vehicle begins to roll backward, the front wheels should catch on the curb and prevent it from moving further.

    * Uphill with no curb
        * With no curb to brace your vehicleâ€™s wheels should the parking brake fail, 
            the best you can do is aim the car so that it will not roll toward the center of the road. 
            Turn your wheels toward the right side of the road so that it would roll away from traffic.

    * Downhill with a curb
        * When parked facing downhill and there is a curb present, turn the wheels toward the curb. 
            If the parking brake fails and the car rolls, it will not get far before the front wheels are blocked by the curb.

    * Downhill with no curb
        * If you are parked facing downhill and there is no curb, point your wheels towards the right side of the road. 
            If the vehicle rolls, it should move away from the street rather than colliding with traffic.
