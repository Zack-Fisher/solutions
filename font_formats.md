# mysterious stuff hidden in font formats

recently visiting a college classroom, i ran into a font on the slideshow
near the front of the room that had different glyphs for the same character.
eg. there was "e" three times in a word, and it looked slightly different each time.

what's that about? that's strange.

i have no idea man

## otf
what's special about it? 

- otf supports chords of characters as glyphs of their own, which is good for stuff like script fonts.


## ttf
the simpler, older font format.
