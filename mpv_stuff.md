# mpv

## cool stuff

in the terminal, try 

```bash
mpv <link_to_video>
```

you can literally just watch youtube videos and twitch streams out of the box and it works perfectly.

with nyxt, you could probably setup a keybinding to open a link in mpv, which would be a really nice way to 
browse youtube without the ui

## easy config file

located at `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`

most command-line arguments can be passed in here, just 
remove the -- and it works out of the box.
