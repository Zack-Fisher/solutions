# autorandr

just use 

```bash
autorandr horizontal
```

and monitors should set themselves up properly in simple cases. nice!!!

(why doesn't it work in the first place?)

i was having a problem where this laptop wouldn't connect properly with a monitor, but every other laptop was fine. why?
i could project to the monitor with just inputting xrandr --auto, but it was still messed up.
