# using bc

## bc overview

bc works on a very simple state machine design, it's a live env with variables and everything,
entirely procedural with a nice syntax

## application

bc works naturally as a programmers calculator, and has a fairly simple
concept of different bases.

## dealing with bases

### ibase

the input base

### obase

the output base

### example

```bc
ibase = 16
obase = 2

0A + 0B
```

outputs `101`.
very nice!!!

consider using this for quick calculations and conversions.

## shifts

use << and >>, it's what you'd expect.
